# Shell setup

I use [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) on OS X.  This is my simple setup for
new machines.

The included `install.sh` symlinks my `config.fish` and dotfiles from the right
places.  Subsequent runs of `install.sh` will rename the existing files before
symlinking.  It's quite simple, really.
